            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny’s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as
            a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            “ Before joining the bootcamp,
            I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was
            encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
            wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not
            disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
            assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took
            my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
            fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
            developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
            developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
